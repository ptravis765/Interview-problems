These are all the folders I have done in order to try and complete the interview challenges.

"PrimeNumberGenerator" contains the java code I used in order to create a program that would generate all the prime numbers between two user entered number values
ex: 7900 and 7920 would output the numbers 7901, 7907, and 7919 as they classify as prime numbers


"interview_server" and "membersUI" are both used for the same problem. "interview_server" contains the Javascript code used to create the URLs where the ReactJS code can connect to, 'fetch' the data, and convert it to JSON in order to output it. And "membersUI" contains the ReactJS code to make everything function and viewable to users.
