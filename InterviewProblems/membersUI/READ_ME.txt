This folder contains all the files I used in order to create my ReactJS app


index.html:
This file is used in order to create a way for the web page to be viewed by users


index.js:
This file is used to create the connection between the ReactJS file (App.js) and the html page that 
will be showing it.


style.css:
This contains the code for all the decorations of the page, such as the form designs.


App.js:
This contains the code that allows the ReactJS app to perform all of its functions as well as incorporate 
its own 'html' applications that will be used to further decorate it on the html page




This code contains 2 flaws:

1. Has to do when you put the elements in ascending or descending
order. Say that your name is at the end and I want it first so I put
it in descending order. When I click on your text box and hit the
"Delete" button instead of deleting you it deletes the element that
was there before.

2. can only delete one thing at a time. Multiple check boxes
checked does not mean all of those things will be removed
