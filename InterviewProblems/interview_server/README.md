This index.js file is used to create a connection to a database and perform 
different queries. Each of these queries will make their own urls that will hold the result 
of the queries so that a fetch() command from a ReactJS file can be used to collect it.
From my research this seems to be a good way in order to connect to a database and perform
queries while using ReactJS.

To activate this 'index.js' file then you must go to the folder in command prompt and enter 'codemon index.js'
