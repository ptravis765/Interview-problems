For this assignment I will be using the beginning of an interface code provided by
IPPSec that will allow me to create a program that will take in values from a user 
and from between those two values a sorted list of all the values that are considered prime
numbers will be made

PROJECT TITLE: PrimeNumberGenerator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creating a program that can generate a list of sorted prime numbers between 2 specified numbers
VERSION or DATE: 1/7/19
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Travis Peterson
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When the main code is active it will ask for the user to enter 2 numbers each one at a time. This is to ensure 
that only numbers will be entered as well as to later on make sure that the smallest number of the 2 will
be the first number to be used. Then an output will be shown showing all of the prime numbers between the 
2 numbers
